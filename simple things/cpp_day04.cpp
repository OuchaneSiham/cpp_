//         The #include is a preprocessor directive tells the compiler to include the content of a file in the source code. 
//         For example, #include<iostream> tells the compiler to include the input-output library which 
//         contains all C++’s input/output library functions.

// //using namespace std
//             This is used to import the entity of the stdnamespace into the current namespace of the program. 
//             It is basically the space where all the inbuilt features of C++ are declared. For example, std::cout.
        
//int main() { }
                // The main() function is the entry point of every C++ program, no matter where the function is located in the program. 
                // The opening braces ‘{‘ indicates the beginning of the main function and the closing braces ‘}’ indicates the ending of the main function.

// // cout<<“Hello World”;
