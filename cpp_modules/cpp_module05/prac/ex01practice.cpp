// 1. try in C++
// The try keyword represents a block of code that may
// throw an exception placed inside the try block. 
// Itâ€™s followed by one or more catch blocks. If an exception occurs, try block throws that exception.


// 2. catch in C++
// The catch statement represents a block of code that is executed 
// when a particular exception is thrown from the try block. 
// The code to handle the exception is written inside the catch block.


// 3. throw in C++
// An exception in C++ can be thrown using the throw keyword. When a program encounters
// a throw statement, then it immediately terminates the current function 
// and starts finding a matching catch block to handle the thrown exception.
